        <p>Hey, my name is Michelle Lee. I am currently a Senior college student expecting to graduate soon. As a full-time attendee, studying and coursework takes up a lot of my time. When I'm not doing something for school or enjoying my leisure time, I study web development.</p>
        <p>So many projects, so little time. I've been looking at many different web technologies to apply to my future projects. I got to make a website for another person, and I'm soon to participate in a web application competition.</p>
        <p>If you are a recruiter looking for new talent, I am actively looking for Web Developer positions in the Greater Los Angeles area. Please contact me through my e-mail.</p>
